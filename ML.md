## Q1) What is the Bias-Variance Tradeoff?

The bias-variance tradeoff is a concept that explains how well a model fits the data for prediction.

### Bias
- **Bias** refers to the difference between the average prediction of the model and the true value being predicted.
  - **Low bias**: The model is well-fitted to the data, leading to accurate predictions.
  - **High bias**: The model is poorly fitted to the data, resulting in inaccurate predictions. This is often a case of **underfitting**.

### Variance
- **Variance** refers to how much the model's predictions change when trained on different subsets of data.
  - **Low variance**: The modelâ€™s predictions are stable and do not fluctuate significantly.
  - **High variance**: The model is sensitive to specific training data, leading to large fluctuations in predictions. This is often a case of **overfitting**.
